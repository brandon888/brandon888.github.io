        <p id="desc">My artwork is a black and white digital drawing of a plate of pancakes with some
blueberries on a plate. The focus and aim of the piece was to create a piece of art that
looked very similar to my photo of pancakes, and emphasizing tones by using black and
white contrast. Also important was the use of many different brushes, such as burnt tree
or soft airbrush to achieve a certain amount of realism. Quite obvious in my drawing are
the principles and light and shadows. There is a slight glisten on the vase and the
blueberries, due to the shiny, reflective surface, and the pancakes show a variance in
tone due to the source of light.<br><br>
Initially trying out a number of brushes, I settled on the Gesinski Ink brush
because graphic texture really appealed to me. I decided to focus mostly on the
pancakes themselves, so I chose to have a rather bland, but still recognizable
background, allowing the pancakes to stand out.<br><br>
I started off the entire drawing with an outline of the key figures in the photo.
Using a red fine tip allowed for a solid, easy to see line to base the rest of my drawing
upon. I first experimented with several different brushes, and ended up liking Gesinski
ink’s smooth, clean appearance. I started the insides of the pancakes with a darker shade,
which got lighter and lighter as I worked to the edge of the pancake. I used burnt tree to
create that uneven, sort of bumpy feel to the pancake. I then drew the plate and
background with the round and flat brush, both giving me the sort of dissociated feeling
that I was looking for. The blueberries were drawn with several shades of Gesinski Ink
and I used the soft airbrush to add the glisten. Finally, I created the vase, using the
special triangulum brush and large spots of Gesinski Ink to recreate the special texture
of the vase. Again, I used soft airbrush to add some reflective elements.<br><br>
I didn’t encounter too many significant problems drawing this piece. It was
mainly some difficulties starting the piece, and knowing how to improve it once I was
done. My first problem was having no idea where to start. I had difficulty looking at the
photo, and wrapping my head around the idea of capturing that with Procreate.<br><br>
However, after trying a ton of brushes, I finally found one that felt good to me. The red
outline in the beginning was really crucial. The next problem I encountered was the vase.
I had no idea how to capture the detail and unique reflective properties of the vase. In
the end, I decided to create a simplified version to go with the graphic style of my
pancakes, and used soft airbrush again to create reflection.<br><br>
Working with a partner came with both pros and cons. The pro was that I could
get a second opinion on my drawings and the different brushes I used. However,
describing my technique and style to him proved quite difficult, and it took some
explaining and demonstration for him to understand how to mimic it. In the end, I think I
merged the two sides quite well and the final piece came out as expected. I drew the left
side of the photo and Shiv drew the right side, and I merged the two together at the end.
The big idea was to understand how tones and different brushes are sufficient to
create realistic pieces of art without the need for color. In this piece I really tried to
emphasize lighting with the soft airbrush and different shades.<br><br>
My goals for this piece was people to be able to recognize it as pancakes and to
really experiment with different brushes and get more comfortable with Procreate and
drawing in general. I was definitely able to achieve, more than even my initial
expectation. I found such a wide variety of useful brushes that could be used in so many
different ways.<br><br>
I learned a lot creating this piece of art. The most important things I learned was
utilizing different brushes and opacities to continuously finetune and eventually create a
nice, recognizable texture. I learned that layering is a big part of art. Most of my pancake
drawing consisted of me layering different shades over and over again to get the 3D look.
This piece will influence my future art as I have a much better grasp of tones and
opacity.<br><br>
My biggest tip for next year’s students is to not be lazy with your layers. In the
beginning it might seem like layers aren’t that important, but as the drawing becomes
more complicated, a single mistake can cost a lot, and layers make it much easier to
draw the background without affecting foreground.
