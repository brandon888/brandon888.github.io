          1. Explain the concept behind your logo. How does it represent you? Use three
    words to describe the logo. Do they best represent you?<br><br>
    Cheerful,
    Identity,
    Passion,<br><br>
    I feel like this logo accurately represents many aspects of my life and what is
    most meaningful to me. As I said earlier, the brainstorming process allowed me to
    connect the different aspects of my life and to explore my identity. At this point in my
    life, I feel like the most important thing to me is following my passions and taking
    opportunities. Computer science is something Iâ€™m passionate about, and I felt like a
    computer logo would be represent me. In life, there are always inevitable ups and
    downs, but I try hard to look past the downs and remember that life is only as
    meaningful as you make it. That is why I love a more comical approach at art,
    choosing to give life to my logo and using a cheerful color scheme.<br><br>
    These three words perfectly represent me, and what I strive to be: someone
    passionate about life, some cheerful who always tries to make others laugh, and
    someone who cares deeply about my own unique identity.<br><br>
    How does your logo work in terms of the Elements and Principles? Please
    explain (Positive and negatives space, use of colour, balance, etc) Use clear
    photos your of sketches and research as part of the reflection.<br><br>
    In striving to create a more cartoony logo that fit my personal style, I chose
    not to strictly follow the principles of design, but to take a slightly different approach
    at them. The different sized eyes and asymmetrical legs created a lack of balance and
    proportion, but gave the character unique features that could stand out. The straight
    face instead of a smiley face gave the computer an emotion of indifference that was
    up for interpretation. The legs, arms, and feet are oddly proportioned, as commonly
    seen in cartoon characters. This, to me, invokes a feeling humor, which is exactly what
    I wanted to bring into the logo. Also important in my logo was the use of space and
    color. The space between the body and the legs, again invokes this lighthearted,
    comical feeling, as well as the use of cheerful, vibrant colors.<br><br>
    2. What part of the process did you enjoy the most? The technical/digital or
    hand drawn aspect? What were the pros and cons of drawing by hand and on
    the ipad?<br><br>
    Using an iPad, like the previous projects, was so fun and convenient. It allowed
    me to portray the images in my head much more easily than with a pen or pencil.
    Again, the use of layers allowed me to draw freely without worrying too much about
    mistakes. The color detection tool allowed me to use the exact colors I wanted and I
    could easily drag colors into the images. Save for the therapeutic feeling of coloring on
    paper, this allowed me to experiment with colors much more conveniently. However,
    I will admit that drawing on paper allows me to have a much better grasp of line
    thickness compared to the perfectly smooth, glossy touch of the Apple Pencil on the
    iPad. This is why I prefer to write my notes on paper much more than on an iPad.
    Overall, I still feel like the convenience and ability to explore different color schemes
    and brushes on the iPad provides a much better experience for art.
    Do you actually like your logo?<br><br>
    I absolutely do. As soon as I thought of the final idea for my logo, something happened in
    my brain and I was happy that I created something that represented myself so well. Although
    the extension tasks showed that it may not be the best for marketing purposes, I feel I
    achieved my purpose in this task.
